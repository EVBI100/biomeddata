## High-Throughput Sequencing

### Description
High-throughput sequencing (HTS) can range from metagenome sequencing to whole-genome sequencing and proteome sequencing, and can be performed through various applications such as short-read (Illumina) platforms and long-read (PacBio, and. nanopore) platforms. Here, we provide information on data

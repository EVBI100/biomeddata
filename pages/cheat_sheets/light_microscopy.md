## Optical Light Microscopy
<!--Example: High-Throughput Screening-->


### Description
Light microscopy technologies has been widely adopted to mordern biological and medical research projects. As the field grows, the number of imaging technique, processing method as well as the size of the data increases every day. To avoid chaos in the late stage of project period, the data management of light microscopy data needs to be considered, planed and executed throughout the data life cycle.

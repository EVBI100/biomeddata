## Biological macromolecular crystallography
<!--Example: High-Throughput Screening-->

### Description

Biological macromolecular crystallography is used to investigate three-dimensional structures of macromolar molecules sucha as proteins. The experiments usually involve 3 components: The crytals of the molecules of intrest, a source of x-rays and a detector.


### Type of data

#### X-Ray detector specific raw data formats
- There are various proprietary data formats of the various detector vendors
- These are mostly not open file formats

#### TIFF for x-ray diffraction patterns
- [Tag Image File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) or TIFF is used as a universal exchange format for diffraction patterns
- Usually no metadata prior to aquistion
- This is an open format

#### macromolecular Crystallographic Information File
- [PDBx/mmCIF](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.fd28en) is a dictionary of data archiving macromolecule crystallographic experiments and their results. 
- Usually no metadata prior to aquistion
- This is an open format
